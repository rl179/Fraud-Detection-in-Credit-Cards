# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using Python and scikit-learn.

## Project Overview
The system uses a Random Forest Classifier to identify potentially fraudulent credit card transactions. It handles imbalanced data using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn imbalanced-learn
```

## Features
- Data preprocessing and scaling
- Handling imbalanced datasets using SMOTE
- Random Forest Classification
- Model evaluation with various metrics
- Visualization of results

## Usage
Run the main script:
```bash
python FraudDetection.py
```

## Data Visualization in Power BI
